#### Description:

The primary aim of this endeavor was to not only showcase technical prowess but also to craft a distinctive brand identity. Drawing inspiration from the world of casual dining, I meticulously incorporated recognizable UI/UX design elements and curated a captivating color palette. The result is a visually appealing virtual dining experience.

#### The project's outcomes reflect a journey of growth and accomplishment:

🔹Thorough Research: Diligent research paved the way for well-defined development procedures, ensuring a strong foundation.

🔹Agile Methodologies: The project adhered to agile methodologies, meticulously planning, analyzing, designing, and constructing each component of the website.

🔹Database Interaction: Database interactions are a critical component of the project, with support for CRUD operations based on user access levels—empowering both administrators and customers.

🔹Dynamic Content: The website seamlessly integrates dynamic web content, streamlining administrative operations like content addition, deletion, and editing.


**Technologies Used: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, UML, SQL, XAMPP, PhpMyAdmin, Visual Studio Code**

HTML, JavaScript, CSS: The backbone of web development, these languages shape the structure, interactivity, and aesthetics of the site.

Bootstrap: Employed for its responsive design capabilities, Bootstrap ensures an engaging user experience across devices.

PHP: Serving as the powerhouse behind the scenes, PHP facilitates server-side scripting for dynamic content generation.

UML: Unified Modeling Language is employed to meticulously design and visualize the project's architecture.

SQL: This essential language powers the project's database management and querying.

XAMPP and PhpMyAdmin: These tools provide the robust local development environment necessary for crafting and testing the website.

Visual Studio Code: This trusted code editor played a pivotal role in the development process.

***This mock website project encapsulates my evolution as a web developer and designer, demonstrating not only technical proficiency but also the ability to create a compelling online brand presence. It stands as a testament to my commitment to excellence and innovation, showcasing the fusion of technology and aesthetics in the digital realm.***

#### Project Goals and Current Status:
*While my aspirations for this project were vast, time constraints limited the scope of its development. As a result, there are known bugs and areas that require improvement. However, I am actively working on addressing these issues during my free time.*

## How to run: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
* IMPORTANT!
  - XAMPP is needed to run download it first
  - Then download the "ecommerce.website.zip" file in this repository
  - Extract the zip file to C:\xampp\htdocs. Make sure it keeps "ecommerce.website" as the folder that contains all the php files and such.
  - The Admin user already exists as seen in the "admin" table in the database. In order to log in through the admin section the site uses a separate web interface for admin handling. Login credentials are as follows
      - username: Admin1
      - password: Pass1

* Import database tables:
  - Run XAMPP Control Panel as Admin
  - Click "Start" on Apache and MySQL
  - Click "Admin" in MySQL row on XAMPP Control Panel - Should be directed to PhpMyAdmin
  - Make sure no other database name is "ms_db" otherwise database and tables will not be imported
  - On the ribbon click on the "Import" tab 
  - Under "File To import:" click "Choose File" and navigate to where the "ms_db" file has been saved and open ms_db.sql
  - Import complete

* Run Website:
  - Open web browser
  - In the URL type: "http://localhost/ecommerce.website/home.php"
  - For admin URL type: "http://localhost//ecommerce.website/admin/index.php"
  - Run complete 🙂
